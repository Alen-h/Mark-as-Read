> **Privacy-First Approach:** Our extension is designed with privacy as a core principle. We collect only the minimal data necessary for functionality and store everything locally on your device.

## 1. Overview

This Privacy Policy explains how the "Mark as Read" Chrome extension ("Extension", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our browser extension.

- Synchronize your marked pages across devices using Chrome's sync storage

## 4. Data Storage and Security

### 4.1 Local Storage

All data collected by our extension is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage APIs. We do not transmit your data to external servers or third parties.

### 4.2 Chrome Sync

If you have Chrome sync enabled, your marked pages data may be synchronized across your devices through Google's secure sync service. This is handled entirely by Chrome and follows Google's privacy and security standards.

### 4.3 Data Security

We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data:

- All data is stored using Chrome's secure storage APIs
- No data is transmitted over the internet by our extension
- Access to your data is limited to the extension's functionality

## 5. Data Sharing and Third Parties

**We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties.** Your marked pages data remains entirely within your control and on your devices.

The only exception is Chrome's sync service, which is controlled by Google's privacy policy and only operates if you have Chrome sync enabled.

## 6. Your Rights and Controls

You have full control over your data:

- **Access:** View all your marked pages through the extension's history feature
- **Delete:** Remove individual pages or clear all data through the extension interface
- **Export:** Your data can be exported from Chrome's storage for backup purposes

## 7. Permissions Explained

Our extension requires the following permissions to function:

- **Active Tab:** To get the current page's URL and title when you mark it
- **Tabs:** To display read indicators on marked pages
- **Host Permissions (all websites):** To inject read indicators on any website you visit

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and not for data collection beyond what's described in this policy.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date below. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

If we make significant changes to how we handle your data, we will notify users through the extension's update mechanism.
